**HELLO-ATOM** a coder is born!

A project to develope coding and web development skills.  

Being detail oriented, patient and dedicated helps too.

Take the time to think as clearly as possible, this is challenging

but what's not right.  Attend to details and enumerate them in a file 

just like this.


Tell us what you plan to do.  Do it, then tell us what you did.  

With just so many words... Code, drink water, code bath, code eat, code then

sleep, code while sleeping, see the codes as little sheeps you need to 

protect.  Wake, put ya code on... Github.:)
